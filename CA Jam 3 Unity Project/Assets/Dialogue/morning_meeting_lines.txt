"Hello everyone! Good to see all your faces fresh and ready for the day ahead. One small hiccup though gang. Damian, our beloved floor manager, is on vacation! So happy for him, but that does mean someone is going to need to pick up his work while he’s gone. Any volunteers? Alrighty then so it’s settled! Intern! Since you’re already ahead of the schedule, we’ll be asking you to help out a little with some small things to keep things moving along. Don’t worry! The boss has already written out most tasks for the day. You’ll find it on your desk."
"Alright guys. Another day and another chance for success. Unfortunately, there was a local animal escape at a nearby zoo and our good friend Shandra discovered she was actually allergic to cats and won’t be coming in today. Apparently bigger cats mean bigger allergies! Thanks to that everyone will be splitting some of their work to keep the office going strong. We all have to look out for our family. Everyone’s work list has been updated already and you’ll find it waiting for you on your desk."
"Hello everyone! I want to welcome back Shandra from her small allergy scare. All the animals are safely back in the zoo and nobody was hurt. However, she is still recovering a bit so we’ll expect everyone to cover for her. Also, Dahbia will be taking the day off. She has been selected for an interstellar collaborative effort. Who knew aliens existed and they needed help coding their software to work on wifi? I certainly didn’t. That does mean we will need to pick up a little extra work around the office to make sure this family still runs smoothly though. That means you’re up intern- I think you’ll be able to handle a few extra tasks."
